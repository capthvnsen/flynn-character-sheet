FLYNN — VISUAL DESCRIPTION
Fire Genasi Hexblade 5 / Swashbuckler 10
Scene: Outside the Wizard's Mansion

================================================================================

THE FIGURE

A lithe Fire Genasi man stands in the shadow of an iron gate, his skin the color of cooling embers — deep amber with veins of faint orange light pulsing beneath the surface. His hair is living flame, slicked back and controlled, flickering like a torch held steady against the wind. Faint wisps of smoke curl from his temples, dissipating into the night air. His eyes are molten gold, catching the moonlight with an inner glow that never quite dims.

THE FACE

Sharp features. High cheekbones. A knowing smirk tugs at the corner of his mouth — the expression of someone who's already found the first three security flaws and is mentally drafting the invoice. A thin scar traces his jawline, barely visible against the warmth of his skin. He looks mid-thirties, but with Genasi, it's impossible to tell.

THE ARMOR

Mithral half-plate, polished to a dark gunmetal sheen, fitted perfectly to his frame. The chest piece is etched with subtle diamond patterns — harlequin shapes, a ghost of his jester past — visible only when the light catches them right. A high collar of dark leather rises to his jaw. No cape, no flourish. Function over fashion, but the function is immaculate.

THE WEAPONS

A slender rapier hangs at his left hip, its guard forged to resemble curling flames frozen mid-dance. The blade is thin, elegant, and slightly too long — a duelist's weapon. At his right hip, three throwing daggers sit in a concealed bandolier, their handles wrapped in black leather. No visible sheaths — they're meant to be drawn fast.

THE HANDS

Black leather gloves, the fingertips worn thin from years of lockpicking. Faint burn marks stain the palms — occupational hazard of handling your own flames. On his right ring finger, a silver band pulses with faint arcane light: the Ring of Spell Storing, three spells coiled inside, waiting.

THE GEAR

A compact leather satchel hangs across his back — thieves' tools, a coil of silk rope, a grappling hook with cloth-wrapped prongs. Tucked under his left arm is a worn leather folio, brass corners dented from use. Inside: contracts, invoices, a quill, and a small pot of ink. Business materials.

THE STANCE

He leans against a wrought-iron fence post, arms crossed, weight on one leg. Casual. Unhurried. Like he's waiting for a friend, not casing a fortified wizard's tower. His head is tilted slightly, eyes tracing the roofline, counting windows, noting the flicker of magical wards along the parapets.

================================================================================

THE SETTING — WIZARD'S MANSION

A Gothic spire of dark stone rises against the purple-black sky, its windows glowing with sickly green light. Gargoyles crouch at the corners, too still to be mere statues. Arcane sigils shimmer across the iron-banded doors. The garden is overgrown, thorned vines crawling up the walls like grasping fingers. A faint hum of magic vibrates in the air — wards, alarms, probably worse.

Flynn exhales a thin trail of smoke, pushes off the fence, and rolls his shoulders.

"Perimeter assessment: two hundred gold. Ward bypass: negotiable. Let's see what you've got."

He steps into the shadows and disappears.
