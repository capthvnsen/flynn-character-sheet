## Background: The Consultant

**Former Life:** Court jester who learned that the fool sees everything, hears everything, and is trusted with nothing... which means no one guards their secrets around you.

**Current Profession:** "Security Consultant" — breaks into places to expose vulnerabilities. For a fee.

**Services:**
- Perimeter assessment: 25 gp
- Ward bypass (basic): 50 gp
- Ward bypass (arcane): 150 gp
- Guard "reassignment": 75 gp/guard
- Discretion fee: Negotiable

**Quirks:**
- Always leaves an invoice
- Refers to B&E as "penetration testing"
- The flames in his eyes flicker when he smiles
- Treats Hexblade's Curse as "filing a formal complaint"

---

## Combat Tactics

### Standard Turn
1. Bonus Action: Hexblade's Curse (if high-value target)
2. Action: Booming Blade attack (triggers Sneak Attack via Rakish Audacity)
3. Movement: Walk away (Fancy Footwork prevents opportunity attack)
4. Enemy choice: Stay still, or chase and take thunder damage

### Darkness Ambush
1. Cast Darkness centered on self
2. You see through it (Devil's Sight), enemies don't
3. All your attacks have advantage (unseen)
4. All attacks against you have disadvantage
5. Fish for 19-20 crits, Eldritch Smite when you land one

### Emergency Defense
- **Uncanny Dodge:** Reaction to halve one attack
- **Evasion:** DEX saves become trivial
- **Misty Step:** Bonus action escape
- **Shield (from Ring):** +5 AC as reaction
- **Absorb Elements (from Ring):** Halve elemental damage, add to next attack

### Anti-Wizard Kit
- Counterspell (native + Ring = 2-3 available)
- Evasion (survive Fireballs)
- Devil's Sight + Darkness (break line of sight for targeting)
- High initiative (+9) to act before they buff

## Art Prompt

A Fire Genasi man with smoldering ember-orange skin and eyes that flicker like candle flames. His hair is made of controlled fire — not wild, but slicked back and professional, like flames frozen mid-dance. Faint wisps of smoke curl from his temples.

**Expression:** A knowing smirk — the look of someone who's already found your secrets and is deciding what they're worth.

**Attire:** A refined take on a jester's aesthetic. Dark, fitted leather armor with subtle diamond patterns (harlequin nod) in charcoal and deep crimson. A high collar. Mithral half-plate underneath, polished but practical. No bells — he outgrew those.

**Details:**
- An elegant rapier at his hip, its guard shaped like curling flames
- A silver ring on his right hand that faintly glows (Ring of Spell Storing)
- A small leather folio tucked under one arm — contracts and invoices
- Burn marks on his gloves from handling his own flames

**Pose:** Casual confidence. Leaning against a doorframe he clearly wasn't invited through, or examining a magical ward with professional interest.

**Mood:** Charming and dangerous. Part con artist, part assassin, all business.
