---

## 1. HEXBLADE WARLOCK FEATURES (Levels 1-5)

### Level 1: Hexblade Patron Features

#### **Hexblade's Curse** (1/short or long rest)
- **Activation:** Bonus action, target within 30 feet you can see
- **Duration:** 1 minute (or until target dies, you die, or you're incapacitated)
- **Benefits:**
  - +Proficiency Bonus to damage rolls against the target
  - Critical hits on 19-20 against the target
  - If target dies, regain HP = Warlock level + CHA modifier
- **Optimization Note:** At level 15, this adds +5 damage per hit and heals 10+ HP on kill. Use on tough single targets (bosses, mini-bosses).

#### **Hex Warrior** (THE reason for this dip)
- **Medium Armor + Shield proficiency** (huge AC boost)
- **Martial Weapon proficiency**
- **CHA for Attack & Damage:** Touch one weapon at end of long rest; use CHA instead of STR/DEX for attack and damage rolls (no two-handed weapons)
- **Pact Weapon Extension:** If you take Pact of the Blade, your pact weapon ALSO gets CHA to attacks
- **Why This Matters:** Single Ability Dependency (SAD) - CHA handles attacks, initiative (via Swashbuckler), spellcasting, AND social skills

### Level 2: Eldritch Invocations (2 known)

**Best Picks for Stealth/Infiltrator Build:**

| Invocation | Effect | Rating |
|------------|--------|--------|
| **Devil's Sight** | See in magical and nonmagical darkness 120 ft | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Essential for Darkness combo) |
| **Mask of Many Faces** | Disguise Self at will, no spell slot | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Perfect for infiltration) |
| **Misty Visions** | Silent Image at will, no spell slot | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Distractions, fake guards) |
| **Fiendish Vigor** | False Life at will (5-8 THP buffer) | ⭐⭐⭐ (Filler, swap later) |
| **One with Shadows** (5th level) | Invisible in dim light/darkness (action) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Great for infiltration) |

### Level 3: Pact Boon

#### **RECOMMENDED: Pact of the Blade**
- Summon any melee weapon as an action (magic for resistance bypassing)
- Can bond a magic weapon to become your pact weapon
- **Key:** Unlocks Thirsting Blade (Extra Attack) and Eldritch Smite

#### Alternative: Pact of the Chain
- Sprite familiar (invisible scouting, poison sting, detects alignment)
- Imp (invisible, shapechange into rat/raven/spider)
- Good for scouting the wizard's mansion but sacrifices combat power

#### Why NOT Pact of the Tome for This Build
- Ritual casting is nice but doesn't synergize with melee focus
- Book of Ancient Secrets is great but costs an invocation slot

### Level 4: ASI/Feat
- **+2 CHA** (17→19 or 18→20) OR
- **War Caster** (Concentration saves, Booming Blade opportunity attacks, somatic with hands full)

### Level 5: 3rd-Level Pact Magic + 3rd Invocation

#### **Spell Slots at Warlock 5:**
- **2 slots** at **3rd level** (refresh on SHORT rest!)
- This is huge - two 3rd-level spell slots that come back every short rest

#### **Key Invocation: Thirsting Blade** (Pact of the Blade required)
- Extra Attack with your pact weapon
- Essential for melee damage output

#### **ELDRITCH SMITE** (Xanathar's, Pact of the Blade, 5th level)
- When you hit with pact weapon, expend spell slot
- **Damage:** 1d8 + 1d8 per slot level (so 4d8 at 3rd-level slot)
- **Target knocked PRONE** (huge: automatic if Large or smaller)
- **ON CRITS:** All dice doubled! Crit + Eldritch Smite = 8d8 force damage PLUS weapon damage
- **Synergy with Hexblade's Curse:** Crits on 19-20 = more smite opportunities

### Warlock Spell Highlights (Infiltrator Focus)

| Level | Spell | Use Case |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Cantrip | **Booming Blade** | Hit-and-run with Fancy Footwork; punishes movement |
| Cantrip | **Minor Illusion** | Distractions, hiding, creating sounds |
| 1st | **Hex** | +1d6 necrotic per hit, disadvantage on ability checks (Perception!) |
| 1st | **Armor of Agathys** | THP + cold damage to attackers (upcast to 3rd = 15 THP) |
| 2nd | **Darkness** | Create 15-ft darkness sphere; you see through with Devil's Sight |
| 2nd | **Invisibility** | Classic infiltration spell |
| 2nd | **Mirror Image** | No concentration, great defense |
| 2nd | **Spider Climb** | Concentration, but amazing for mansion infiltration |
| 2nd | **Misty Step** | Bonus action teleport 30 ft |
| 3rd | **Fly** | Get over walls, reach windows |
| 3rd | **Counterspell** | Essential vs. evil wizard |
| 3rd | **Hypnotic Pattern** | Crowd control |

## 2. SWASHBUCKLER ROGUE FEATURES (Levels 1-10)

### Core Rogue Features

#### **Sneak Attack Progression**
| Rogue Level | Damage | Total Level (with Warlock 5) |
|-------------|--------|------------------------------|
| 1 | 1d6 | 6 |
| 2 | 1d6 | 7 |
| 3 | 2d6 | 8 |
| 4 | 2d6 | 9 |
| 5 | 3d6 | 10 |
| 6 | 3d6 | 11 |
| 7 | 4d6 | 12 |
| 8 | 4d6 | 13 |
| 9 | 5d6 | 14 |
| 10 | 5d6 | **15** |

**At level 15 (Warlock 5/Rogue 10): 5d6 Sneak Attack**

#### **Expertise** (Rogue 1 and 6)
- Double proficiency on 4 skills total
- **Recommended:** Stealth, Persuasion, Deception, Perception

#### **Cunning Action** (Rogue 2)
- Bonus action: Dash, Disengage, or Hide
- **Note:** Often replaced by Fancy Footwork for Disengage, freeing bonus action for other uses

#### **Uncanny Dodge** (Rogue 5)
- Reaction: Halve damage from one attack you can see
- Excellent survivability in melee

#### **Evasion** (Rogue 7)
- DEX saves for half damage → take NO damage on success, half on fail
- Crucial vs. wizard's Fireballs

### Swashbuckler Subclass Features (Rogue 3+)

#### **Fancy Footwork** (Rogue 3)
- After you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn
- **Key:** Works on ATTACK (hit or miss), not just hit
- **Synergy:** Attack with Booming Blade → walk away → enemy must either stay put OR take Booming Blade's secondary damage to chase you

#### **Rakish Audacity** (Rogue 3)
Two massive benefits:

1. **Initiative Bonus:** Add CHA modifier to initiative rolls
   - With 20 CHA + 14 DEX = +7 initiative before proficiency
   
2. **Sneak Attack Without Allies:**
   - You get Sneak Attack if no creature other than the target is within 5 feet of you
   - Don't need advantage or adjacent allies
   - Perfect for dueling and solo infiltration

#### **Panache** (Rogue 9)
- **Action:** Make Persuasion check vs. target's Insight
- **In Combat (target hostile):** Target has disadvantage on attacks against anyone but you, can't make opportunity attacks vs. others. Lasts 1 minute or until you attack someone else/ally damages them.
- **Out of Combat (not hostile):** Target is charmed for 1 minute. Views you as friendly acquaintance.
- **No save, no slots, unlimited use** - just opposed skill checks
- **Jester Synergy:** Perfect for the theatrical, attention-grabbing jester persona!

#### **Elegant Maneuver** (Rogue 13 - not reached at level 15)
You won't have this in your build.

## 3. MULTICLASS SYNERGIES

### The CHA Stacking Machine

| Ability | CHA Contribution |
|---------|------------------|
| Weapon Attack Rolls | CHA (Hex Warrior) |
| Weapon Damage | CHA (Hex Warrior) |
| Initiative | CHA + DEX (Rakish Audacity) |
| Hexblade's Curse Damage | Proficiency (scales with total level) |
| Hexblade's Curse Healing | Warlock level + CHA |
| Spell Save DC | 8 + Prof + CHA |
| Panache Contest | Persuasion (CHA + Expertise) |
| Face Skills | Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation (all CHA) |

**Result:** You only need high CHA and decent CON. DEX only needs 14 for medium armor.

### The Nova Combo: Sneak Attack + Eldritch Smite on Crit

**Scenario:** You crit (19-20 with Hexblade's Curse active)

| Component | Damage |
|-----------|--------|
| Weapon (Rapier) | 2d8 (crit doubled) |
| CHA to damage | +5 |
| Hexblade's Curse | +5 |
| Sneak Attack (5d6) | 10d6 (crit doubled) |
| Eldritch Smite (3rd slot) | 8d8 (crit doubled) |
| **TOTAL** | 2d8 + 10d6 + 8d8 + 10 |

**Average on Crit:** 9 + 35 + 36 + 10 = **90 damage** in one hit!
Plus target is knocked **prone** (no save).

### The Hit-and-Run Loop

1. **Start of turn:** Move toward enemy
2. **Action:** Attack with Booming Blade (Sneak Attack triggers via Rakish Audacity)
3. **Fancy Footwork:** Enemy can't opportunity attack you
4. **Movement:** Walk away
5. **Enemy's turn:** Must either:
   - Stay put (you're safe)
   - Move to chase you (takes Booming Blade thunder damage)

### Best Level Split Analysis

#### Hexblade 5 / Swashbuckler 10 (Recommended)
✅ 3rd-level Pact Magic (2 slots, short rest recovery)  
✅ Thirsting Blade (Extra Attack)  
✅ Eldritch Smite  
✅ 3 Invocations  
✅ 5d6 Sneak Attack  
✅ Panache (level 9 Swashbuckler)  
✅ Evasion  
✅ Uncanny Dodge  
❌ No Reliable Talent (Rogue 11)  

#### Alternative: Hexblade 3 / Swashbuckler 12
✅ 6d6 Sneak Attack  
✅ ASI at Rogue 12  
❌ Only 2nd-level slots  
❌ No Thirsting Blade (stuck with Booming Blade only)  
❌ No Eldritch Smite  
❌ 2 Invocations instead of 3  

**Verdict:** Hexblade 5 is the sweet spot. You get Extra Attack, 3rd-level slots, and Eldritch Smite. Going deeper into Warlock delays Rogue features too much.

### Key Invocation Picks for Infiltrator (3 slots at Warlock 5)

1. **Devil's Sight** - See in magical darkness (Darkness spell combo)
2. **Mask of Many Faces** - Disguise Self at will (essential for infiltration)
3. **Thirsting Blade** - Extra Attack (combat necessity)

**Alternative loadout if skipping Extra Attack:**
1. Devil's Sight
2. Mask of Many Faces  
3. One with Shadows (become invisible in darkness, action to activate)

## 4. 2014-SPECIFIC RULES & ERRATA

### Important 2014 Rules to Know

1. **Booming Blade/Green-Flame Blade Range:** In 2014 (pre-Tasha's errata), these had a range of 5 feet. Post-Tasha's errata changed them to Self (5-foot radius), which matters for War Caster opportunity attacks - **check with your DM which version they use**.

2. **Hex + Hexblade's Curse Stacking:** They're separate effects and stack fully. You can have both on the same target.
   - Hex: +1d6 necrotic per hit
   - Hexblade's Curse: +Proficiency to damage, crit on 19-20, healing on kill

3. **Pact Magic + Spellcasting:** Warlock slots are completely separate from other class spell slots. They don't combine for multiclass spell slot calculation but CAN be used to cast spells from either class.

4. **Sneak Attack Once Per Turn:** You can only Sneak Attack once per turn, but this can be on YOUR turn OR someone else's turn (e.g., opportunity attack, Commander's Strike).

5. **Hex Warrior Weapon:** You choose ONE weapon at end of long rest. If you have Pact of the Blade, your pact weapon ALSO benefits (so potentially two weapons).

6. **Eldritch Smite Decision Point:** You declare AFTER hitting, before damage is rolled. This means you can see if you crit before deciding to smite.

### Common Misconceptions

❌ **Wrong:** "Eldritch Smite works like Divine Smite"  
✅ **Correct:** Eldritch Smite uses WARLOCK spell slots only and knocks prone. Divine Smite uses any spell slot.

❌ **Wrong:** "Sneak Attack requires advantage"  
✅ **Correct:** Sneak Attack requires advantage OR an ally within 5 ft of target OR (for Swashbuckler) being the only creature within 5 ft of you

❌ **Wrong:** "Hexblade's Curse is a spell"  
✅ **Correct:** It's a class feature, not a spell. Can't be Counterspelled, doesn't require concentration.

## 5. OPTIMAL BUILD ORDER (Level 1-15)

### For a Fresh Level 15 Character

| Level | Class | Key Gains |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | **Rogue 1** | Sneak Attack 1d6, Expertise (Stealth, Persuasion), Skills |
| 2 | **Warlock 1** | Hexblade patron, Hex Warrior (CHA attacks!), Hexblade's Curse |
| 3 | **Warlock 2** | 2 Invocations (Devil's Sight + Mask of Many Faces) |
| 4 | **Rogue 2** | Cunning Action |
| 5 | **Rogue 3** | Swashbuckler (Fancy Footwork, Rakish Audacity), 2d6 SA |
| 6 | **Warlock 3** | Pact of the Blade, 2nd-level slots |
| 7 | **Warlock 4** | ASI: +2 CHA (or War Caster) |
| 8 | **Warlock 5** | Thirsting Blade (Extra Attack), Eldritch Smite, 3rd-level slots |
| 9 | **Rogue 4** | ASI: +2 CHA (cap at 20) or feat |
| 10 | **Rogue 5** | Uncanny Dodge, 3d6 SA |
| 11 | **Rogue 6** | Expertise (Deception, Perception) |
| 12 | **Rogue 7** | Evasion, 4d6 SA |
| 13 | **Rogue 8** | ASI: +2 DEX or +2 CON or War Caster |
| 14 | **Rogue 9** | Panache, 5d6 SA |
| 15 | **Rogue 10** | ASI: Resilient (CON) or +2 DEX |

### Alternative Start: Warlock First
If your campaign involves lots of early social/darkness encounters:

| Level | Class | Reasoning |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Warlock 1 | Hex Warrior CHA attacks from level 1 |
| 2 | Warlock 2 | Invocations for infiltration |
| 3+ | Rogue | Build Sneak Attack and subclass |

**Trade-off:** Starting Warlock gets WIS save proficiency instead of DEX (Rogue). DEX saves are more common, so Rogue start is usually better.
